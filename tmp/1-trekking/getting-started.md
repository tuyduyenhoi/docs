Before we build our first gallery, let's have a look at what you need.

That's easy: any folder with photos and videos!
You can have nested folders and use any mix of photo/video formats.
Using the default configuration, each folder will become an album.

For example:

```
input
  |__ paris
  |    |__ day 1
  |    |   |__ img001.jpg
  |    |   |__ img002.jpg
  |    |__ day 2
  |        |__ img003.jpg
  |        |__ img004.jpg
  |__ tokyo
       |__ img005.png
       |__ vid001.mp4
```

You're now ready to install thumbsup and create your gallery!
